## Contributing In General
Our project welcomes external contributions. If you have an itch, please feel
free to scratch it.

To contribute code or documentation, please submit a [pull request](https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/health-patterns/pulls).

A good way to familiarize yourself with the codebase and contribution process is
to look for and tackle low-hanging fruit in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/health-patterns/issues).
Before embarking on a more ambitious contribution, please quickly [get in touch](#communication) with us.

**Note: We appreciate your effort, and want to avoid a situation where a contribution
requires extensive rework (by you or by us), sits in backlog for a long time, or
cannot be accepted at all!**

### Proposing new features

If you would like to implement a new feature, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/health-patterns/issues)
before sending a pull request so the feature can be discussed. This is to avoid
you wasting your valuable time working on a feature that the project developers
are not interested in accepting into the code base.

### Fixing bugs

If you would like to fix a bug, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/health-patterns/issues) before sending a
pull request so it can be tracked.

### Merge approval

The project maintainers use LGTM (Looks Good To Me) in comments on the code
review to indicate acceptance. A change requires LGTMs from two of the
maintainers of each component affected.

For a list of the maintainers, see the [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) page.

## Legal

Each source file must include a license header for the Apache
Software License 2.0. Using the SPDX format is the simplest approach.
e.g.

```
/*
 * (C) Copyright <holder> <year of first update>[, <year of last update>]
 *
 * SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
 */
```

We have tried to make it as easy as possible to make contributions. This
applies to how we handle the legal aspects of contribution. We use the
same approach - the [Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO)](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/docs/source/DCO1.1.txt) - that the LinuxÂ® Kernel [community](https://elinux.org/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin)
uses to manage code contributions.

We simply ask that when submitting a patch for review, the developer
must include a sign-off statement in the commit message.

Here is an example Signed-off-by line, which indicates that the
submitter accepts the DCO:

```
Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
```

You can include this automatically when you commit a change to your
local git repository using the following command:

```
git commit -s
```

## Communication
Connect with us by opening an [issue](https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/health-patterns/issues).

## Setup
Avlearie health-patterns is built with Maven and requires Java 8 or higher.  Since it is composed of several patterns, each pattern will be stored in a separate sub-folder of the health-patterns repository.  To build any pattern, navigate to the folder containing the pattern and execute:

> mvn clean install

## Testing
To ensure a working build, please run the full build from the root of each pattern affected by your pull request before submitting.

## Coding style guidelines
Avlearie health-patterns is new. Formatting is not strictly enforced, but please consider the following points as you change the code:

1. Write tests. Pull Requests should include necessary updates to unit tests (src/test/java of the corresponding project) and integration tests (in the fhir-server-test project)

2. Use comments. Preferably javadoc.

3. Keep the documentation up-to-date. Project documentation exists under the docs directory. We have a CHANGELOG for tracking user-visible changes, a Conformance page for documenting conformance to the specification, and a User Guide for FHIR Server administrators.

4. Use spaces (not tabs) in java source. For this we have a checkstyle rule which will fail the build if you're using tabs. We also prefer spaces over tabs in JSON and XML, but its not strictly enforced.

5. Use spaces after control flow keywords (they're not function calls!); if/for/while blocks should always have { }

Leave the code better than you found it.
