# nifi-health-patterns-bundle

This bundle contains all custom processors created by/for the health-patterns project.  Currently, this includes:

- **ACDProcessor** - This processor feeds the current flow file to the Annotator for Clinical Data (ACD) to add NLP annotations to the current FHIR resource.
- **[GenerateFHIRFromMimic](./docs/GenerateFHIRFromMimic.md)** - This processor reads all patients from a source Mimic database and produces one FHIR bundle per patient representing all known data for that patient.
