# Context awareness with ACD

A significant advantage of configuring nlp insights with ACD is that in addition to simple concept detection, the context of the concept is considered.

This allows nlp-insights to avoid creating resources for concepts that do not apply to the patient.

Some example phrases with concepts that will not result in derived resources.

* The patient does not have a myocardial infarction
* The patient's mother had a myocardial infarction last year
* The patient is concerned that he may have had a myocardial infarction

The nlp-insights service takes advantage of ACD attributes for improved handling of these scenarios.

# Example
This example creates a diagnostic report where the text mentions a myocardial infarction that is not for the patient.

## Configure nlp-insights to use ACD for NLP
If the nlp-insights service has not been configured to use ACD by default, follow the steps [here](./configure_acd.md).

## Send the example diagnostic report to the nlp-insights service
The Text data in a diagnostic report must be base64 encoded, which can be done with the base64 command in bash.

```
B64_REPORT_TEXT=$(echo "The patient's mother had a myocardial infarction last year." | base64 -w 0)
```

The text can now be included in a diagnostic report and sent to the nlp-insights service, the output of the service is stored in a file /tmp/output.json

```
curl -o /tmp/output.json -XPOST localhost:5000/discoverInsights  -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' --data-binary @- << EOF

                "url": "DiagnosticReport"
            }
        }
    ]
}
EOF
```

## Inspect the response bundle
Although the input text mentions a condition, a resource is not created because the condition is not for the patient. The Diagnostic report and bundle are not modified in any meaningful way.
