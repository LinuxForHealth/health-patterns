### It is generated by the build process: ./gradlew createRequirementsTextForDev
### build.gradle defines the dependencies needed for development and production.
### This file is generated in the SOURCE directory, so that an IDE can be setup for development.
### Using this file, you can install all required dependencies for development into your IDE's venv.
### The pinned.txt that is created in the build directory has only the dependencies needed for production.
### This file may be safely checked into version control so that others may set-up their environments.
### Use this file with "pip install -r requirements_dev.txt" to install dependencies into your venv.
### Most IDEs will allow you to specify the file when setting up the venv, 
### and you won't have to run that command directly.
