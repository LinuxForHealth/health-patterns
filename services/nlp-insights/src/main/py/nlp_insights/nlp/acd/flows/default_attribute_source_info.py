# There are two root types used as keys for this map
# Fhir Resource & Codeable concept reference type.
# For a concept reference type, we can use a mapping that assumes the text has a specific context,
# such as when we enrich an allergy intolerance coding.
#
# For a FHIR resource, this is the resource we want to create from unstructured text.
# We can't assume the text is only about that resource, or even says anything about that
# kind of resource.
#
# We can be a lot more liberal in what we consider matching attributes and concepts when we
# are aware of the context of the text.
#
# This is why it is possible that we have different mapping for creating Conditions vs
# enriching condition codings.
#
# It's also why in the actual rules we can get away with assuming 'Diagnosis' is talking about an
# allergy diagnosis when enriching an AllergyIntolerance coding...but we could not use that same rule
# if we were to someday try and create an allergy intolerance resource from a diagnostic report.
