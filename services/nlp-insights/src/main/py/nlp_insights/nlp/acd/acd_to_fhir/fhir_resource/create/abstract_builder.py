"""
Defines an abstract class to build a new resource from a ACD attribute and source.

This allows code to be shared when deriving new resource types from ACD insights.
The abstract class handles common details such as iterating over relevant attributes,
building insight extensions in the new resource, updating the insight extensions with
new spans, etc.

Concrete classes implement the specific details as to how to create the new resource,
and to set the derived codings from ACD into the resource.
