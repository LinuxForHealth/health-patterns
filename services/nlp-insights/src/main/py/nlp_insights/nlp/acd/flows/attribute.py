"""Utilities to find the object that is the source of the attribute of interest.  The source contains information
about the CUI for the attribute, as well as other "low-level" information.

This has the functionality to decide what is an attribute of interest in an ACD response, and also
how to find the source for that attribute. There is always a single source CUI object for an attribute, and
that object is where most of the coding information and extensions come from.

Although nlp-insights supports only a single flow, in the future different flows may
define different attributes of interest. Additional flows might be necessary when/if the
ACD pipeline is customized so that it returns additional attributes that are of interest
to nlp-insights.

The source may be stored within different properties of the container for different flows,
it can be a number of different types, depending on the attribute.
Each of these types has similar properties.

A SourceSearchMap determines which attributes to use and where to look for source CUI objects.
