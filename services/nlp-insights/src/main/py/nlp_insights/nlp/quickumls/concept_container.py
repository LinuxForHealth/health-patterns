    preferred_name - UMLS preferred name for the concept
    types - UMLS type names for the concept.
            These can be used as an aid to disambiguate concepts.
            These names are converted from the quickUmls returned
            data. An example value might be "umls.DiseaseOrSyndrome"
    similarity - QuickUMLS similarity score. The meaning of this value
                 depends on how the instance of QuickUMLS is configured.
                 In general QuickUMLS returns results with a similarity score
                 that is above a configured threshold. nlp-insights can use
                 this score of returned values to further select the best
                 CUI out of the returned set of CUIs.

    The QuickUMLS definition of these values can found in the QuickUMLS
    documentation at: https://github.com/Georgetown-IR-Lab/QuickUMLS
