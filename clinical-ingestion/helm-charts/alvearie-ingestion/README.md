# Alvearie Clinical Ingestion Helm Chart

## Introduction

This [Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm) chart installs the [Alvearie Clinical Ingestion pattern](/clinical-ingestion) in a Kubernetes cluster.

The [Alvearie Clinical Ingestion pattern](/clinical-ingestion) is comprised of multiple components described in more detail in the pattern's main page, and using this Helm chart you can optionally enable/disable components of that pattern.

## Pre-Requisites

- Kubernetes cluster 1.10+
- Helm 3.0.0+
- PV provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure.

## Installation

### Checkout the Code

Git clone this repository and `cd` into this directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alvearie/health-patterns.git
cd health-patterns/clinical-ingestion/helm-charts/alvearie-ingestion
```

### Create a new namespace (Optional)

It is recommended, though not required, that you create a namespace before installing the chart in order to prevent the various artifacts that will be installed by it from mixing from the rest of the artifacts in your Kubernetes cluster, in an effort to make it easier to manage them.

```bash
kubectl create namespace alvearie
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=alvearie
```

### Install the Chart

Install the helm chart with a release name `ingestion`:

```bash
helm install ingestion .
```

### Install the Chart with De-Identification Enabled

This same chart can be used to install the patient de-identification pattern, which adds a de-identification service and a secondary FHIR server for de-identified clinical data.
In order to install that pattern run the command below:

```bash
helm install ingestion . -f de-id-pattern-values.yaml
```

### Using the Chart

After running the previous `helm install` command, you should get a set of instructions on how to access the various components of the chart and using the [Alvearie Clinical Ingestion pattern](../../).

## Uninstallation

To uninstall/delete the `ingestion` deployment:

```bash
helm delete ingestion
```

Deletion of charts doesn't cascade to deleting associated `PersistedVolume`s and `PersistedVolumeClaims`s.
To delete them:

```bash
kubectl delete pvc -l release=ingestion
kubectl delete pv -l release=ingestion
```

## Configuration

Each requirement is configured with the options provided by that Chart.
Please consult the relevant charts for their configuration options.

| Parameter                | Description                                                                                                        | Default   |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| --------- |
| `kafka.enabled`          | Enable [Kafka](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/incubator/kafka)                                         | `true`    |
| `nifi.enabled`           | Enable [Nifi](https://github.com/cetic/helm-nifi)                                                                  | `true`    |
| `nifi-registry.enabled`  | Enable [Nifi Registry](../nifi-registry)                                                                           | `true`    |
| `fhir.enabled`           | Enable [Spark](../fhir)                                                                                            | `true`    |
| `zookeeper.enabled`      | Enable [Zookeeper](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/zookeeper)                                | `true`    |

## Monitoring

There is a grafana-based monitoring solution that has been included as part of this chart.  It is disabled by default in the chart, however, it can be enabled by setting the following options to `true` (note that they are currently all set to `false`).

```bash
kafka.metrics.kafka.enabled
kafka.metrics.jmx.enabled
kafka.metrics.serviceMonitor.enabled
kube-prometheus-stack.enabled
```

It is important to note that due to a limitation in grafana that causes multi-install collisions, only one instance of the chart should be installed when the monitoring solution is turned on.

## Bulk Export configuration

It is possible to configure the Fhir server to allow bulk export.  For this to happen, there are a number of prerequisites that must be completed.  Bulk export assumes that the export artifact will be placed in a Cloud Object Store bucket.  You will need to create a bucket and set up service credentials for access.  In addition, you will need to configure a PKCS Trust Store file to include new information for your particular cos endpoint.

### Bucket and Credentials
#### Note that these instructions target IBM Cloud Object Store but other cloud storage will work as well (details will vary)

1. Create a cloud object store resource
1. Create a new bucket for export artifacts within that resource (make a note of the `bucket name` for later)
1. Click on configuration to find the public endpoint and the location (make a note of the `endpoint` and the `location` for later)
1. Click on Service Credentials and choose New Credential. Pick a name and choose writer. Open the new credential (make a note of the `apikey` and the `iam_serviceid_crn` for later)

### Setting up the PKCS Trust Store

In the helm chart, navigate to `clinical-ingestion/helm-charts/alvearie-ingestion/charts/fhir/binaryconfig/` where you will find a file called `fhirTrustStore.p12`.  In order for fhir to communicate with cos you need to update this file with certificate information from your cos endpoint.  Execute the bash command below to get and store the cos certificate relative to your endpoint:

`echo "" | openssl s_client -showcerts -prexit -connect <YOUR ENDPOINT>:443 2> /dev/null | sed -n -e '/BEGIN CERTIFICATE/,/END CERTIFICATE/ p' > out.pem`

where `YOUR ENDPOINT` is the endpoint noted above.  The result is stored in a file called `out.pem`.  Now, we will update the p12 file with this new information.  The following command will take the contents of the `out.pem` file and add them to the `fhirTrustStore.p12` file.

```bash
keytool -importcert -noprompt \
           -keystore fhirTrustStore.p12  -storepass change-password \
           -alias my-host -file out.pem
```

After the update, delete the `out.pem` file from the `binaryconfig` directory.

### Update Chart Configuration to Setup Bulk Export

In the `values.yaml` file for the helm chart, locate the `bulkExportConfig` section under the FHIR Configuration.  Fill in the values using the the information you noted above.

  - `cosBucketName` The bucket name you chose
  - `cosLocation` The region (for example, us-east)
  - `cosEndpointInternal` The cos endpoint from the bucket config
  - `cosApikey` The api key from your service credentials
  - `cosSrvinstid` The srv instance id from your service credentials
  - `batchUserPw` The fhirAdmin user password

Save the file and you are ready to install the chart using the instructions above.
